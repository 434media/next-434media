You canâ€™t tell meaningful stories from a distance which is why our team headed to Brownsville for RGV Startup Week 2025. This wasnâ€™t a one-off trip. Weâ€™ve been building relationships in the Rio Grande Valley for months.

At 434 Media, we believe storytelling is a team sport. It takes care, consistency, and cultural awareness to bring someone elseâ€™s vision to life, especially when those stories are shaping the future of public health, economic opportunity, and innovation.

Whether itâ€™s SDOH work in the Valley, closing the digital gap with TechBloc, supporting ecosystem builders at Emerge and Rise, or sharing a message with a connected community â€” it all comes back to one thing: access. Access to health, tech, capital, or simply a seat at the table. The stories we tell are about real people building real things. Actions Speak Louder!

      At TechBlocâ€™s Conclave, we saw what consistency really does for a community. 
      And at Nucleate Demo Day, we witnessed bold ideas backed by serious science.
