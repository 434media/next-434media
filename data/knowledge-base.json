      "content": "# VIDEO Requirements\nBest practices for hosting video files and managing the biggest impact on monthly cost - BANDWIDTH \nAdditional Tips (Web):\n# Image Requirements\nResponsive Images\n• Provide images in multiple sizes:\n• Consistent Naming: Use a clear naming convention (i.e., \"imagename-large.jpg\", \"imagename-medium.jpg\", \"imagename-small.jpg\")\nStatic Images:\n• JPEG: Suitable for photographs and images with many colors and smooth gradients. Offers good compression with minimal quality loss.\n• PNG: Ideal for images with sharp edges, text, and logos. Supports transparency and lossless compression (maintaining original image quality).\n• WebP: A modern format that often provides better compression than JPEG or PNG, but browser support might be limited.\nAnimation Use Cases (Web):\n• SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Best for simple animations, logos, and icons. Vector graphics are resolution-independent, making them suitable for high-resolution displays.\n• GIF: Suitable for simple animations with limited color palettes.\n• WebP: Also supports animation and can offer better compression than GIF.\nCaching (Web)\n• Browser Caching: Utilize browser caching headers (e.g., Cache-Control) to instruct browsers to store images locally. This reduces the need to download the same image repeatedly.\n• CDN Caching: Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache images on servers closer to users, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption - CLOUDFLARE or AWS\nLazy Loading (Web)\n• Only load images that are visible within the user's viewport. This prevents unnecessary data downloads\nHTML Attributes to use (Web)\n• srcset Attribute: This HTML attribute allows you to specify different image sources for different screen sizes.",

      "content": "Company Presentation: \n\n\n### Why It Matters What We Do\nBecause real results don’t come from empty words—they come from action, alignment, and relentless connection.\nAt 434 Media—right here in San Antonio—we bridge the divide between creativity and outcomes. We’re not just storytellers; we’re strategic connectors that bring brands, innovators, and communities together through high-impact, ROI-driven content that moves people to act. We do this by leveraging niche audiences and executing precision-targeted content at scale—so every project we touch delivers meaningful results. \nWhy does it matter? Because consistency is the foundation of trust. As we noted in our own reflections, “Progress isn’t accidental—it’s deliberate,” and consistency is strategy. In a city where tech, culture, and policy intersect daily, that trust powers real transformation. \nAnd it matters because we don’t just show up—we stay connected. Whether centering life‑science innovation like the AIM Conference, nurturing local creatives alongside Latinx storytellers, or capturing moments that honor community resilience, what we do amplifies voices and builds bridges across culture, industry, and identity. \n\n### Statement (options you can adapt)\nOption A:\n“It matters what we do because action with intention builds trust—and trust fuels transformation. At 434 Media, we don’t simply create content—we forge connections. Through consistent, creative, and measurable storytelling, we connect brands to audiences, innovators to impact, and communities to their own narratives. That’s why what we do matters.”\nOption B:\n“What we do matters because creativity without purpose is just noise. We believe that aligned intent, strategic consistency, and genuine connection transform stories into movements. In the places where tech, culture, and identity collide—like here in San Antonio—we make it clear: when you see our work, you don’t just witness it—you join it.”\n\n### Why This Matters for You\n• Aligns with your core mission: Emphasizes measurable impact, ROI, and strategic storytelling.\n• Reinforces 434 Media’s values: Trust through consistency, action over words, and community-rooted storytelling.\n• Connects emotion with strategy: Shows that what you do isn’t just creative—it catalyzes real change and engagement.",
